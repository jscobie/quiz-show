# Challenge 04 Web-APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

This project was built to showcase my ability to supply a working Quiz on coding topics to impress that I have learned the various steps of CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Web-API's and can use them to make a website.

When a user arrives, they click a start button and they will begin a timed test. When they answer one question they will be prompter for another. If the user answers incorrectly the time is subtracted from the clock. The game ends when the timer reaches 0 or user has exhausted all questions. Once the game ends the user can save their initials and score.
